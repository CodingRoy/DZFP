# Skeleton
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodingRoy/Skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodingRoy/Skeleton)

Good start for a web app with PSR-4 autloading and optional PSR-2 consistency.<br>
Basicly you can make any web app based on this, you can do test with phpunit and see the status from travis.<br>
You just need to link your account with Travic-CI(https://travis-ci.org/), and edit the links in this Readme file.

Goodluck!
